scrabble
========

The scrabble AI I wrote for my Logic of Inference final project in Winter 2018. The AI is designed to always play the word that scored the most points given the contents of its tray and the boardstate, including any score modifiers. This project uses the Standard Library by Sedgewick and Wayne http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/
